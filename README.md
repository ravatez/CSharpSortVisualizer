## Overview

Sorting algorithms are techniques used to arrange a collection of items into a specific order. This project aims to visualize these algorithms and provide detailed insights into their operation, performance, and complexity. 

This visualization tool is a great way to learn how sorting algorithms work and how their performance compares for various input sizes.
